# note-taker

For this project, I was using Express.js, Heroku as a deployment application, and Node.js to create a backend, server-side application. In here, I ran npm install express fs uuid, so that it can install express for me along with files for fs and uuid. Fs allows the files to write to a specific location while uuid allows me to create a unique id for the notes being made. What was difficult was trying to figure out the JSON parsing, since I kept getting errors such as "Unexpected "<"..." and 404 errors and 500 errors. I overthought the problem but was able to fix everything in time.

Below is a photo if the note I created with the website:

I am also able to delete the note by clicking on the trash can! But also, you cannot delete the first note, since its a placeholder for how the notes will be stored. I did not get to change that yet.
